#### Playlists

There are two youtube playlists with video tutorials. The first provides a general introduction to key features in Radiant. The second covers topics relevant in a course on business analytics (i.e., Probability, Decision Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Regression, and Simulation).

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNhtaetb48EedDmWPUqytnQv-qxmCGtxi" target="_blank">Introduction to Radiant</a>
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNhtaetb48EdKRIY7MewCyvb_1x7dV3xw" target="_blank">Radiant Tutorial Series</a>

#### Explore

Radiant is interactive. Results update immediately when inputs are changed (i.e., no separate dialog boxes) and/or when a button is pressed (e.g., `Estimate` in _Model > Estimate > Logistic regression (GLM)_). This facilitates rapid exploration and understanding of the data.

#### Cross-platform

Radiant works on Windows, Mac, or Linux. It can run without an Internet connection and no data will leave your computer. You can also run the app as a web application on a server.

#### Reproducible

To conduct high-quality analysis, simply saving output is not enough. You need the ability to reproduce results for the same data and/or when new data become available. Moreover, others may want to review your analysis and results. Save and load the state of the application to continue your work at a later time or on another computer. Share state files with others and create reproducible reports using [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). See also the section on `Saving and loading state` below

If you are using Radiant on a server you can even share the URL (include the SSUID) with others so they can see what you are working on. Thanks for this feature go to [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5).

#### Programming

Although Radiant's web-interface can handle quite a few data and analysis tasks, you may prefer to write your own R-code. Radiant provides a bridge to programming in R(studio) by exporting the functions used for analysis (i.e., you can conduct your analysis using the Radiant web-interface or by calling Radiant's functions directly from R-code). For more information about programming with Radiant see the [programming](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/programming.html) page on the documentation site.

#### Context

Radiant focuses on business data and decisions. It offers tools, examples, and documentation relevant for that context, effectively reducing the business analytics learning curve.

## How to install Radiant

- Required: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 4.0.0 or later
- Required: [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/)

In Rstudio you can start and update Radiant through the `Addins` menu at the top of the screen. To install the latest version of Radiant for Windows or Mac, with complete documentation for off-line access, open R(studio) and copy-and-paste the command below:

```r
options(repos = c(RSM = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran", CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages("radiant")
```

Once all packages are installed, select `Start radiant` from the `Addins` menu in Rstudio or use the command below to launch the app:

```r
radiant::radiant()
```

To launch Radiant in Rstudio's viewer pane use the command below:

```r
radiant::radiant_viewer()
```

To launch Radiant in an Rstudio Window use the command below:

```r
radiant::radiant_window()
```

To easily update Radiant and the required packages, install the `radiant.update` package using:

```r
options(repos = c(RSM = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran", CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("radiant-rstats/radiant.update", upgrade = "never")
```

Then select `Update radiant` from the `Addins` menu in Rstudio or use the command below:

```r
radiant.update::radiant.update()
```

See the [installing radiant](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/install.html) page additional for details.

**Optional:** You can also create a launcher on your Desktop to start Radiant by typing `radiant::launcher()` in the R(studio) console and pressing return. A file called `radiant.bat` (windows) or `radiant.command` (mac) will be created that you can double-click to start Radiant in your default browser. The `launcher` command will also create a file called `update_radiant.bat` (windows) or `update_radiant.command` (mac) that you can double-click to update Radiant to the latest release.

When Radiant starts you will see data on diamond prices. To close the application click the <i title='Power off' class='fa fa-power-off'></i> icon in the navigation bar and then click `Stop`. The Radiant process will stop and the browser window will close (Chrome) or gray-out.

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorials are available at <https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/> and in the Radiant web interface (the <i title='Help' class='fa fa-question'></i> icons on each page and the <i title='Help' class='fa fa-question-circle'></i> icon in the navigation bar).

Individual Radiant packages also each have their own [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) sites:

* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.data
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.design
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.basics
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.model
* http://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.multivariate

## Reporting issues

Please use the GitHub issue tracker at <a href="https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues" target="_blank">github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant/issues</a> if you have any problems using Radiant.

## Try Radiant online

Not ready to install Radiant on your computer? Try it online at the link below:

<a href="https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant" target="_blank">https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/radiant</a>

Do **not** upload sensitive data to this public server. The size of data upload has been restricted to 10MB for security reasons.

## Running Radiant on shinyapps.io

To run your own instance of Radiant on shinyapps.io first <a href = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/install.html" target = "_blank">install Radiant and its dependencies</a>. Then clone the <a href="https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant" target="_blank">radiant</a> repo and ensure you have the latest version of the Radiant packages installed by running `radiant/inst/app/for.shinyapps.io.R`. Finally, open `radiant/inst/app/ui.R` and [deploy](https://shiny.posit.co/articles/shinyapps.html) the application.

## Running Radiant on shiny-server

You can also host Radiant using [shiny-server](https://posit.co/download/shiny-server/). First, install radiant on the server using the command below:

```r
options(repos = c(RSM = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran", CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages("radiant")
```

Then clone the <a href="https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant" target="_blank">radiant</a> repo and point shiny-server to the `inst/app/` directory. As a courtesy, please let me know if you intend to use Radiant on a server.

When running Radiant on a server, by default, file uploads are limited to 10MB and R-code in _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will not be evaluated for security reasons. If you have `sudo` access to the server and have appropriate security in place you can change these settings by adding the following lines to `.Rprofile` for the `shiny` user on the server. 

```bash
options(radiant.maxRequestSize = -1)  ## no file size limit
options(radiant.report = TRUE)
```

## Running Radiant in the cloud (e.g., AWS)

To run radiant in the cloud you can use the customized Docker container. See  <a href = "https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docker" target="_blank">https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docker</a> for details

## Saving and loading state

To save your analyses save the state of the app to a file by clicking on the <i title='Save' class='fa fa-save'></i> icon in the navbar and then on `Save radiant state file` (see also the _Data > Manage_ tab). You can open this state file at a later time or on another computer to continue where you left off. You can also share the file with others that may want to replicate your analyses. As an example, load the state file [`radiant-example.state.rda`](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/examples/radiant-example.state.rda) by clicking on the <i title='Save' class='fa fa-save'></i> icon in the navbar and then on `Load radiant state file`. Go to _Data > View_ and _Data > Visualize_ to see some of the settings from the previous "state" of the app. There is also a report in _Report > Rmd_ that was created using the Radiant interface. The html file <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/examples/radiant-example.nb.html" target="_blank">`radiant-example.nb.html`</a> contains the output.

A related feature in Radiant is that state is maintained if you accidentally navigate to another web page, close (and reopen) the browser, and/or hit refresh. Use `Refresh` in the <i title='Power off' class='fa fa-power-off'></i> menu in the navigation bar to return to a clean/new state.

Loading and saving state also works with Rstudio. If you start Radiant from Rstudio and use <i title='Power off' class='fa fa-power-off'></i> > `Stop` to stop the app, lists called `r_data`, `r_info`, and `r_state` will be put into Rstudio's global workspace. If you start radiant again using `radiant::radiant()` it will use these lists to restore state. Also, if you load a state file directly into Rstudio it will be used when you start Radiant to recreate a previous state.

**Technical note**: Loading state works as follows in Radiant: When an input is initialized in a Shiny app you set a default value in the call to, for example, numericInput. In Radiant, when a state file has been loaded and an input is initialized it looks to see if there is a value for an input of that name in a list called `r_state`. If there is, this value is used. The `r_state` list is created when saving state using `reactiveValuesToList(input)`. An example of a call to `numericInput` is given below where the `state_init` function from `radiant.R` is used to check if a value from `r_state` can be used.

```r
numericInput("sm_comp_value", "Comparison value:", state_init("sm_comp_value", 0))
```

## Source code

The source code for the radiant application is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/radiant-rstats>. `radiant.data`, offers tools to load, save, view, visualize, summarize, combine, and transform data. `radiant.design` builds on `radiant.data` and adds tools for experimental design, sampling, and sample size calculation. `radiant.basics` covers the basics of statistical analysis (e.g., comparing means and proportions, cross-tabs, correlation, etc.) and includes a probability calculator. `radiant.model` covers model estimation (e.g., logistic regression and neural networks), model evaluation (e.g., gains chart, profit curve, confusion matrix, etc.), and decision tools (e.g., decision analysis and simulation). Finally, `radiant.multivariate` includes tools to generate brand maps and conduct cluster, factor, and conjoint analysis.

These tools are used in the _Business Analytics_, _Quantitative Analysis_, _Research for Marketing Decisions_, _Applied Market Research_, _Consumer Behavior_, _Experiments in Firms_, _Pricing_, _Pricing Analytics_, and _Customer Analytics_ classes at the Rady School of Management (UCSD).
