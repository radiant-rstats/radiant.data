> Create pivot tables to explore your data

If you have used pivot-tables in Excel the functionality provided in the _Data > Pivot_ tab should be familiar to you. Similar to the <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/explore.html" target="_blank">_Data > Explore_</a> tab, you can generate summary statistics for variables in your data. You can also generate frequency tables. Perhaps the most powerful feature in _Data > Pivot_ is that you can easily describe the data _by_ one or more other variables.

For example, with the `diamonds` data loaded, select `clarity` and `cut` from the `Categorical variables` drop-down. The categories for the first variable will be the column headers but you can drag-and-drop the selected variables to change their ordering. After selecting these two variables, and clicking on the `Create pivot table` buttone, a frequency table of diamonds with different levels of clarity and quality of cut is shown. Choose `Row`, `Column`, or `Total` from the `Normalize by` drop-down to normalize cell frequencies or create an index from a summary statistic by the row, column, or overall total. If a normalize option is selected it can be convenient to check the `Percentage` box to express the numbers as percentages. Choose `Color bar` or `Heat map` from the `Conditional formatting` drop-down to emphasize the highest frequency counts.

It is also possible to summarize numerical variables. Select `price` from the `Numeric variables` drop-down. This will create the table shown below. Just as in the <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/view.html" target="_blank">_Data > View_</a> tab you can sort the table by clicking on the column headers. You can also use sliders (e.g., click in the input box below `I1`) to limit the view to values in a specified range. To view only information for diamonds with a `Very good`, `Premium` or `Ideal` cut click in the input box below the `cut` header.

You can also create a bar chart based on the generated table (see image above). To download the table in _csv_ format or the plot in _png_ format click the appropriate download icon on the right.

> Note that when a categorical variable (`factor`) is selected from the `Numeric variable` dropdown it is converted to a 0-1 (binary) variable where the first level is coded as 1 and all other levels as 0.

### Filter data

Use the `Filter data` box to select (or omit) specific sets of rows from the data to tabulate. See the help file for <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/view.html" target="_blank">_Data > View_</a> for details.

### Store

The created pivot table can be stored in Radiant by clicking the `Store` button. This can be useful if you want do additional analysis on the table or to create plots of the summarized data in <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/visualize.html" target="_blank">_Data > Visualize_</a>. To download the table to _csv_ format click the download icon on the top-right.

### Report > Rmd

Add code to [_Report > Rmd_]<https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/report_rmd.html>{target="_blank"} to (re)create the pivot table by clicking the <i title="report results" class="fa fa-edit"></i> icon on the bottom left of your screen or by pressing `ALT-enter` on your keyboard. 

If a plot was created it can be customized using `ggplot2` commands (e.g., `plot(result) + labs(title = "Pivot graph")`). See <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/data/visualize.html" target="_blank">_Data > Visualize_</a> for details.
