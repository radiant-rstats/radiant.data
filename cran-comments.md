## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this update I fixed a strange issue related the patchwork package. At least it was strange to me. In the code below `any` should not be needed. However, it seems that a patchwork object can have length == 1 and still have is.na return a vector of length > 1. Perhaps there are other libraries that have objects like this but I have never seen this before.

My apologies for submitting a new version so soon after the previous version. 

```r
length(x) == 0 || (length(x) == 1 && any(is.na(x)))
```
